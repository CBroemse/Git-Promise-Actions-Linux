    programming the syntax that means just the code of javascript itself
    via maniipulating functions in another preferred programming language reveals the logic of js ;)
    just writing an object from my limited perspective for the 'use-case' seems to involve 
    36 differnet if clauses for the syntax level that does explicitly Not involve: 
      - functionality
      - politics and
      - x other random factors ?!

#### Focosing on functionality
   this is a try
   every line per file yields two different types (not objects yet)
   that are formatted from bash linux script in a browser(yes also the window guz)
   to javascript (JS) objects. This program deals with that: Under the premise that:
     if ntest And/Or nInt of seriesTestjs.sh in linuxJsobjects(main) 
        [String] == objects => jsCommand (object) ->  take notes in unique8.sh/js && unique(j)9.sh/js
